<!-- In this example, a button element is created using HTML and its appearance is customized using CSS. The appearance property is set to none, which removes any platform-specific styling that the browser might apply by default. The border, padding, and background-color properties are also set to give the button a customized look.

You can see how this code would be rendered in a web browser, with the button appearing as a light gray box with a black border and some padding, ready for clicking -->
