            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a

<!-- The CSS "resize" property determines if an element is resizable by the user and in which direction(s). Possible values are "none" (element is not resizable), "both" (resizable horizontally and vertically), "horizontal" (resizable only horizontally), and "vertical" (resizable only vertically). -->
