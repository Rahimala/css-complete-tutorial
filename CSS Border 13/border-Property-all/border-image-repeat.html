<!-- 
    The border-image-repeat property in CSS is used to specify how a border image should be repeated or stretched to fill the area of the border. The property can take one of four values: stretch, repeat, round, or space.

stretch: The image is stretched to fill the entire border.
repeat: The image is repeated to fill the entire border.
round: The image is repeated as many times as possible without being clipped, and the remaining space is filled with the last image.
space: The image is repeated as many times as possible without being clipped, and the remaining space is distributed evenly between the images.
It is often used in combination with other border-image properties, such as border-image-source and border-image-slice.

border-image-repeat: stretch | repeat | round | initial | inherit;
