<!-- 
    border-image-source is a CSS property that specifies the source of an image to be used as a border for an element. It can be used in conjunction with the border-image-slice and border-image-width properties to create a border around an element that is made up of an image. The property takes a value of a URL that points to an image file, or the keyword none if no image should be used. The border-image-source property sets the path to the image file that will be used as a border. It should be used in conjunction with the border-image-slice and border-image-width properties to achieve the desired effect.
