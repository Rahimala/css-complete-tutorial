<!-- The ul elements are siblings because they are both children of the same parent element (which may be the body element if this HTML snippet is not contained in another parent element).

The concept of sibling elements is important in HTML and CSS because it allows you to target elements that share a common parent and

apply styles selectively to those elements based on their position among their siblings. This is where the :nth-of-type() selector

 comes in handy, as it allows you to select elements based on their position among their siblings of the same element type -->
