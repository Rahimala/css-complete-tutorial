    ==================================
    he inline-size property specifies the size of an element in the inline direction.

Note: The related CSS property writing-mode defines inline direction, and this affects the result of the inline-size property. For pages in English, inline direction is left to right and block direction is downward.

The CSS inline-size and block-size properties are very similar to CSS properties width and height, but the inline-size and block-size properties are dependent on inline and block direction


The CSS inline-size property sets the width of an element on the inline (horizontal) axis. It is commonly used to set the width of an element, such as a div or img. The value can be set in pixels, percentages, or other units of measurement. This property is equivalent to the width property in a block layout, and height property in a inline layout.
