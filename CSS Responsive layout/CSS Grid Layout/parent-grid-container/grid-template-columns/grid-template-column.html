<!-- n this example, we have a grid-container with three columns, each using the 1fr unit to take up an equal fraction of the available space. We also set a 10px gap between each grid item using the grid-gap property.

We have nine grid-item elements, which will be placed into the grid cells defined by the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties. Each item has a background color, padding, text alignment, font size, and border radius applied, to make it easier to see the grid layout. We also use the nth-child pseudo-class to apply a different background color to every other item, for visual interest.

One of the grid items, with the class grid-item--large, is larger than the others and spans across two columns and two rows. This is achieved using the grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start, and grid-row-end properties, which reference the optional grid line names col-start and col-end defined in grid-template-columns.

When you open this HTML file in a browser, you should see a grid with nine items arranged in three columns and three rows. The 1fr unit used in grid-template-columns means that each column will take up an equal fraction of the available space, which allows the grid to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. The grid-item--large element spans two columns and two rows, demonstrating how the grid can be used to create complex layouts. -->
