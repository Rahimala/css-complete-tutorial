<!-- The CSS property "column-span" allows an element to span across multiple columns when using the CSS column layout. By default, an element will only take up space in one column, but using "column-span: all" will allow the element to span across all columns in the container. For example, if you have a div element with "column-count: 3" and a child element with "column-span: all", the child element will span across all three columns. "none"
The element does not span multiple columns. -->
