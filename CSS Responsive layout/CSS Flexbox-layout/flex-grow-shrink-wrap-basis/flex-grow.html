<!-- 

    In CSS, the flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to the other items in a flex container when there is extra space in the container. The value of flex-grow is a number, where 1 is the default value. A value of 2, for example, means the item will take up twice as much space as an item with a value of 1. The space is distributed proportionally among all items with a non-zero flex-grow value. This property can be used in conjunction with the flex-shrink and flex-basis properties to control the size of flex items.



    In CSS, the "flex-grow" property is used to determine how much a flex item should grow relative to the remaining items in a flex container. The value of "flex-grow" is a number, and the default value is 0. A flex item with a value of 1 will grow to fill the remaining space in the container, while a flex item with a value of 2 will grow twice as much as an item with a value of 1. Flex items with a value of 0 will not grow at all.
