    <h2>The CSS Flex Shorthand Property </h2>
    <p>There are six flex items in the container below. The first can grow three items wider than the other items. You
        might have to resize the browser to see. The second can shrink two times more than the others. The last four
        items are set at to an initial width of 1em.</p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div id="grow">1</div>
        <div id="shrink">2</div>
        <div class="example">3</div>
        <div class="example">4</div>
        <div class="example">5</div>
        <div class="example">6</div>
    </div>

<!-- Flex shorthand in CSS is a way of writing Flexbox layout CSS using a more concise and readable syntax. It makes use of the "flex" property, which is a shorthand for the "flex-grow", "flex-shrink" and "flex-basis" properties. The "flex" property can be used to define the main-axis and cross-axis properties of an element in a single line of code.

For example, the following CSS code uses the "flex" property to define the main-axis and cross-axis properties of an element: -->

<!-- he "flex" property takes three values:

The first value defines the flex-grow property, which controls the element's ability to grow in relation to other elements in the container.
The second value defines the flex-shrink property, which controls the element's ability to shrink in relation to other elements in the container.
The third value defines the flex-basis property, which controls the element's initial size before any growth or shrinkage.
In the example above, the .item will take all the available space in the container with a default size before any growth or shrinkage. -->
