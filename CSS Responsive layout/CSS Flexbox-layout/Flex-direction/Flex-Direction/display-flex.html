<!-- The CSS display: flex property is used to create a flexible container, known as a flex container, that can be used to arrange its child elements in a flexible manner, either horizontally or vertically.

By default, a flex container is arranged in a single row, and child elements are positioned along the main axis (horizontally). However, you can use the flex-direction property to change the main axis and arrange elements in columns instead. The justify-content and align-items properties are used to control the position of elements along the main and cross axes, respectively. -->




<!-- In this example, the .container class defines a flex container with a height of 500px. The flex-direction property is set to row, which means that the elements will be positioned along the main axis (horizontally). The justify-content property is set to center, which aligns the elements along the main axis to the center. Finally, the align-items property is set to center, which aligns the elements along the cross axis to the center. -->
