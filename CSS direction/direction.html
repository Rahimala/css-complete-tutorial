<!-- direction: ltr | rtl | initial | inherit;

    The CSS direction property is used to specify the direction of text in an element. The default value is "ltr" (left-to-right), but it can also be set to "rtl" (right-to-left) for languages that are written from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew.
 -->

 <!-- It should be noted that setting the direction property to "rtl" will also cause the element's text alignment to be reversed (i.e. left-aligned text will become right-aligned and vice versa). Additionally, the property is inherited, meaning that if you set the direction of a parent element, all of its children elements will inherit that direction as well, unless you explicitly set a different direction for them -->
