<!-- CSS variables are declared with the -- syntax, followed by the variable name. The value of the variable can be assigned using the : syntax. To use the value of a CSS variable, it can be referenced using the var() function. -->


<!-- In this example, we have declared a CSS variable --primary-color with a value of blue in the :root pseudo-class. The :root pseudo-class represents the highest-level element in the document tree, and it is a common place to declare global variables that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. The value of the --primary-color variable is then used in the a selector, where the color property is set to var(--primary-color). This means that the text color of any a element in the document will be blue.

CSS variables are supported in modern browsers and can be used in conjunction with preprocessors like Sass and Less to provide even more power and flexibility in stylesheet management. -->
