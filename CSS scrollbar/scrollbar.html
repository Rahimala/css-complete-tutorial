    <!-- The CSS "scrollbar" property is a shorthand property that sets the properties of an element's scrollbar. It can set the width, style, color and other aspects of the scrollbar. However, it is not a standard property and may not be supported by all browsers. Instead, it's recommended to use other CSS properties, such as "overflow" and "::webkit-scrollbar", to style the scrollbar. -->
