<!-- background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2, ...); -->
<!-- Linear gradients transition from top to bottom, by default -->

<!-- In CSS, the linear-gradient function creates a linear gradient as the background image. The linear gradient transitions smoothly from one color to another, or from multiple colors to multiple other colors. -->



<!-- Note that the height and width properties are set to 100vh and 100vw respectively, which sets the height and width of the element to the full height and width of the viewport. This creates a full-screen gradient background. -->


<!-- In this example, the gradient starts from red on the left and transitions to yellow on the right. The to right part of the function defines the direction of the gradient, which in this case is from left to right. -->

<!-- You can also specify the starting and ending points of the gradient using degrees or radians -->

<!-- background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow); -->
