        content-box: This is the default value of box-sizing. The dimension of element only includes ‘height’ and ‘width



        border-box: In this value, not only width and height properties are included but you will find padding and border inside of the box for example .box {width: 200px; border: 10px solid black;} renders a box that is 200px wide.

    <!-- The "box-sizing" property in CSS is used to define how the dimensions of an element are calculated. The default value is "content-box", which means that the width and height of an element only include the content, and do not include the padding and border.

There are two possible values for the "box-sizing" property:

"content-box" : This is the default value, which means the width and height of an element only include the content, and do not include the padding and border.
"border-box" : This value includes the content, padding, and border within the element's total width and height.
This property can be used to include the padding and border within the element's dimensions, making it easier to size elements and make layout calculations. -->
