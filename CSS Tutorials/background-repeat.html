        If you search online, you will
        find lots of resources that offer
        background textures that you
        can use on your pages.
        Background images are often
        the last thing on the page to
        load (which can make a website
        seem slow to load). As with any
        images you use online, if the
        size of the file is large it will take
        longer to download.
