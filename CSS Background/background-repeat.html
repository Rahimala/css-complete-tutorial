The background-repeat property in CSS determines how a background image is repeated, if at all. It can have the following values:

repeat: The image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
repeat-x: The image is repeated horizontally only.
repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.
no-repeat: The image is not repeated and is displayed only once.
