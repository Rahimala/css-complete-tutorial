<!-- 
    margin: auto is a CSS property that can be used to horizontally center an element within its containing block. It can be applied to block-level elements, such as div, p, or form, and will cause the element to be centered within its parent element



     margin: auto 1.5rem


     In CSS, "margin: auto 1.5rem" is a shorthand property that sets the margin values for an element.

    The first value, "auto", sets the horizontal margin of the element to be automatically calculated by the browser, which centers the element within its parent container.

The second value, "1.5rem", sets the vertical margin of the element to be 1.5 times the size of the root font-size (which is typically 16px by default), in this case 24px.

So, "margin: auto 1.5rem" will center an element horizontally within its container and give it a 24px margin at the top and bottom.
