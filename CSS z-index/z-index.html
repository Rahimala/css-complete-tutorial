<!-- 
    The CSS z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a higher z-index is always in front of an element with a lower z-index.

The z-index property only works on elements that have a position value of absolute, relative, or fixed.

The default z-index value is auto, which means that the element will be placed on the same stack level as its parent element.



The CSS z-index property specifies the stack order of an element, which is the order in which elements are stacked on top of one another. An element with a higher z-index will be stacked on top of an element with a lower z-index.

The z-index property can take a number value (positive or negative), with larger values indicating a higher stack order. For example, an element with a z-index of 2 will be stacked on top of an element with a z-index of 1.

It's important to note that z-index only works on elements that have a position value of absolute, relative, or fixed. Elements with a position value of static (the default) do not have a z-index and will not affect the stacking order.

Also, the stacking context is determined by an element with a non-static position and z-index value other than 'auto' , all its child element will be stacked in that context.
