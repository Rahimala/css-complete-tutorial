<!-- This code creates three block-level elements with a specified width and height, which are styled as inline-block elements. The inline-block elements are placed on the same line, inside a parent container with a gray background and centered text.

The margin property is used to add a 10-pixel margin around each box, to separate them -->



<!-- inline-block specifies that an element should be placed as an inline-level block container. This means that the element will be treated as a block-level element, but will flow with the text and allow other elements to sit on the same line as it. -->
