/* In this example, the text link is given a position: relative property, and the tooltip text is given a position: absolute property. The display property for the tooltip text is set to none so that it is hidden by default.

When the user hovers over the text link, the :hover pseudo-class is activated, and the display property for the tooltip text is set to inline-block, making it visible. The top and left properties are used to position the tooltip text relative to the text link, and the transform property is used to center it horizontally.

You can customize the appearance of the tooltip by changing the background-color, color, padding, and border-radius properties, as well as its position using the top and left properties. */
