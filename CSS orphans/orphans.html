<!-- The CSS orphans property is used to specify the minimum number of lines that must be left at the bottom of a page when a block element breaks across multiple pages or columns. This property is commonly used in print stylesheets to prevent widows, which are single words or short lines that appear alone at the top of a page.

The orphans property can be used with the widows property to control the number of lines that must be left at the top and bottom of a page when a block element breaks across multiple pages or columns.

Here's an example of how you might use the orphans property in your CSS:

css
Copy code
p {
  orphans: 2;
}
This example specifies that at least 2 lines of the paragraph must be left at the bottom of the page when the paragraph breaks across multiple pages or columns.

It's worth noting that this property is mainly used in print stylesheets and not all browsers support it in web page -->

<!-- It's important to note that this property is only supported by some browsers, and it's mostly used for print media and not for web design. -->
