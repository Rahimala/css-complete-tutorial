<!-- The font-feature-settings CSS property is used to control advanced typographic features in OpenType fonts. It allows you to enable or disable specific OpenType features for text rendered in a web page. The property can be set to either a string containing a specific feature to enable or disable, or to the value "normal" to use the default settings for the font. Some examples of OpenType features that can be controlled with font-feature-settings include ligatures, small caps, and alternate characters. It is supported in all modern browsers -->

<!-- * Use the default settings */
font-feature-settings: normal;

/* Set values for OpenType feature tags */
font-feature-settings: "smcp";
font-feature-settings: "smcp" on;
font-feature-settings: "swsh" 2;
font-feature-settings: "smcp", "swsh" 2; -->
