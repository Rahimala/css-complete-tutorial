<!-- min-height is a CSS property that sets the minimum height of an element. This property specifies the smallest possible height that an element can have, even if its content is shorter than the specified value. -->

<!-- In this example, we've created a div element with the class .container. We've then applied the min-height property to this element with a value of 200px. This means that the minimum height of the .container element will be 200 pixels. -->



<!-- Overall, using the min-height property can help to ensure that elements on a web page are always tall enough to be functional and readable, even on smaller screens.
