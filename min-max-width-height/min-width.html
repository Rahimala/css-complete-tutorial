      <p>This is some text inside a container with a minimum width of 400 pixels.</p>
      <p>If the screen size is smaller than 400 pixels, the container will remain at a minimum width of 400 pixels.</p>

<!--In this example, the min-width property is set to 400px. This means that the element with the class .container will never be narrower than 400px, even if its content is narrower than that. If the element's content is wider than 400px, the element's width will adjust accordingly to fit the content.  -->


<!-- min-width is commonly used in responsive web design to ensure that an element doesn't become too narrow on smaller screens. By setting a min-width, designers can ensure that an element is always wide enough to be readable and functional. Additionally, using min-width can also help to prevent elements from wrapping to multiple lines and becoming difficult to read. -->
