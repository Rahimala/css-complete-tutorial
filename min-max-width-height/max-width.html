<!-- max-width is a CSS property that is used to set the maximum width of an element. This property specifies the largest possible width that an element can have, even if its content is wider. If the element's content is narrower than the max-width value, the element's width will adjust accordingl -->


<!-- In this example, the max-width property is set to 800px. This means that the element will never be wider than 800px, even if its content is wider than that. If the element's content is narrower than 800px, the element's width will adjust accordingly to fit the content.

max-width is often used in responsive web design to ensure that elements don't become too wide on larger screens. By setting a max-width, designers can ensure that an element doesn't stretch too far and become difficult to read. Instead, the element's width will be limited to a comfortable size that's easy to read on any screen -->
