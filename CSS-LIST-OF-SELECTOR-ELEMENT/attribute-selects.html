<!-- Yes, that is correct. The square brackets "[]" are used to specify an attribute selector in CSS. The attribute selector is used to select elements based on their attributes or attribute values.

For example, to select all elements that have a type attribute, the CSS selector could be "[type]". To select all elements with a specific value for an attribute, the attribute value can be added within the brackets. For example, to select all elements with a type attribute equal to "text", the CSS selector could be "[type='text']".

Attribute selectors can also be used with different matching functions like "^=", "$=", "*=" , "~=" and "|=" to select elements with attribute values that starts with, ends with, contains, has a space-separated value or starts with a specific value respectively.

It is important to note that attribute selectors have a lower specificity than class selectors and ID selectors. If there is a conflict between styles applied to an element using an attribute selector and a class or ID selector, the styles from the class or ID selector will take precedence.



[attr]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr.

[attr=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is exactly value.

[attr~=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly value.

[attr|=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value can be exactly value or can begin with value immediately followed by a hyphen, - (U+002D). It is often used for language subcode matches.

[attr^=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is prefixed (preceded) by value.

[attr$=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is suffixed (followed) by value.

[attr*=value]
Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value contains at least one occurrence of value within the string.

[attr operator value i]
Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).

[attr operator value s] Experimental
Adding an s (or S) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-sensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).
