<!-- symbol is used to specify a class selector in CSS. The class selector is used to select multiple elements on a page by their class attribute. For example, if you have multiple HTML elements with a class of "example", you can use the CSS selector ".example" to select all of those elements and apply styles to them.

Class selectors are useful for applying styles to multiple elements that share the same styling, such as a group of headings or a group of buttons. It can also be used with other CSS selectorz -->
