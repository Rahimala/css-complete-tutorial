<!-- The offset-rotate property in CSS is used to define the orientation of an element along the path defined by the offset-path property. The offset-rotate property is used in combination with the offset-path and offset-distance properties to define the position and orientation of an element along a custom path.

Here is an example of how you might use the offset-rotate property in CSS: -->

<!-- In this example, the offset-path property defines a path, the offset-distance property sets the position of the element along the path, and the offset-rotate property sets the orientation of the element along the path. The value of offset-rotate is set to auto, meaning that the element's orientation will be automatically determined based on the shape of the path. -->
