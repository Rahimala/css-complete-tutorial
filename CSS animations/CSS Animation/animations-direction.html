        /* In this example, the animation moves the element 100% to the right over a 2-second duration, with a linear timing function, no delay, and a single iteration in the normal direction. The fill mode is set to both, meaning the animation will apply the styles of the animation both before and after it runs.

<!-- /* Single animation */
animation-direction: normal;
animation-direction: reverse;
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-direction: alternate-reverse;

/* Multiple animations */
animation-direction: normal, reverse;
animation-direction: alternate, reverse, normal;

/* Global values */
animation-direction: inherit;
animation-direction: initial;
animation-direction: revert;
animation-direction: revert-layer;
animation-direction: unset;

The animation-direction sets the direction of the animation & it can take any one of these 4 values –

normal – This is the default direction which is always in forwards direction.
reverse – This is the reverse of the default direction. It means the direction will be backwards.
alternate – First, the animation goes to forward direction in one cycle & then in backward direction in the next cycle.
alternate-reverse – First, the animation goes to the backward direction in one cycle & then in forward direction in the next cycle.
