    <!-- The animation-iteration-count CSS property sets the number of times an animation should run. It can have the following values:

a number (e.g. 2): The animation will run the specified number of times.
infinite: The animation will run indefinitely until it is stopped by some other means (e.g. hovering over an element, etc.).
Here's an example of using the animation-iteration-count property in CSS: -->

<!-- the animation named move will run indefinitely (animation-iteration-count: infinite;) until stopped by some other means. -->
    <title>animation-iteration-count</title>

    <style>
        .box {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: red;
            animation: move 2s ease-in-out;

            /*  Animations Loop css */
            /* infinite â€“ Repeats the animation for an infinite time which means the animation keeps on running foreve */
            animation-iteration-count:1;
        }

        @keyframes move {
            from {
                transform: translateX(0);
            }

            to {
                transform: translateX(200px);
