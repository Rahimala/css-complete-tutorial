    <!-- The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.


        here are 5 important types of position value:

        1/static
        2/relative
        3/absolute
        4/fixed
        5/stick

        static:

         The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.
    
        relative:

        The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top,right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.


        absolute:

        The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

        This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins.



        fixed:

        The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), or the will-change property is set to transform, in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
        
        This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.


        sticky:

        The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.

      
      
      
        This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.




        In CSS, the "position" property is used to specify the type of positioning for an element. The possible values for the position property include:

"static": the default value, elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document
"relative": elements are positioned relative to their normal position
"absolute": elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element, but not the viewport
"fixed": elements are positioned relative to the viewport and will not move when the page is scrolled
"sticky": elements are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
Additionally, the "top", "right", "bottom", and "left" properties can be used to specify the offset of an element from its positioned parent.
