<!-- The @import property in CSS allows you to import one CSS file into another. It is used to include styles from other files, which can help you organize your code and make it easier to maintain. Here is an example of how to use the @import property in CSS:

In a css file main.css

css
Copy code
@import url("styles.css");

/* other CSS styles */

body {
    background-color: blue;
}
In another file styles.css

css
Copy code
/* CSS styles for the header */
header {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
    padding: 20px;
}

/* CSS styles for the main content area */
main {
    margin: 20px;
}
In this example, the @import statement is used to include the styles from the styles.css file in the main.css file. This way, the styles defined in the styles.css file will be applied to the web page along with the styles in the main.css file.

It is worth noting that the use of the @import rule is not recommended as it has a negative impact on the performance of your website, it's better to use a link tag in the head section of your HTML file.
