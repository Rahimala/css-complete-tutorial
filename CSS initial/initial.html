<!-- In CSS, initial is a keyword value that is used to set a property to its default initial value. When you set a property to initial, it will be reset to its default value as if no styles had been applied to it.

For example, if you have a CSS rule that sets the font-size of a paragraph to 16px, and you want to reset it to the default font-size, you can use the initial value like this -->


<!-- Use the inherit keyword to make an element's property the same as its parent.
Use the revert keyword to reset a property to the value established by the user-agent stylesheet (or by user styles, if any exist).
Use the revert-layer keyword to reset a property to the value established in a previous cascade layer.
Use the unset keyword to set a property to its inherited value if it inherits or to its initial value if not.
The all property lets you reset all properties to their initial, inherited, reverted, or unset state at once.CSS shorthand property all.  -->
