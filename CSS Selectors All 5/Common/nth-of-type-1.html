<!-- he :nth-of-type() selector is a CSS pseudo-class that allows you to select elements based on their position among siblings of the same element type.

This selector is used to target specific elements based on their index or position within a parent element. It is written as :nth-of-type(n) where n is a number or keyword that determines which element should be selected.

Here are some examples of how you can use the :nth-of-type() selector in CSS:

:nth-of-type(1) selects the first element of its type within the parent element.

:nth-of-type(even) selects all even-numbered elements of its type within the parent element.

:nth-of-type(odd) selects all odd-numbered elements of its type within the parent element.

:nth-of-type(n+3) selects all elements of its type starting from the third position within the parent element.

By using :nth-of-type(), you can apply different styles to different elements based on their position in the document hierarchy যে-কোনটি. This selector is particularly useful when you need to apply styles to specific elements that cannot be targeted using other selectors.
